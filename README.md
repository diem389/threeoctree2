# threeoctree2

Revision of threeoctree(https://github.com/collinhover/threeoctree) to support the latest version of three.js(r106)
I use ThreeOctree2.ts (typescript), you can use it as js file by just changing extension. 
* update: Remove typescript (July 17, 2019)

## Usage

* Install node package  
yarn 

* Run  
yarn watch 


### Limitations
* In mesh, it only supports triangular faces. The latest version of threejs doesn't support quad(4 vertex) meshes.
